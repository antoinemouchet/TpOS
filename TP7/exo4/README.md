# Dictionary server/client

For this exercice, the code of each part is in the folder of its name so
* client
* server

The ```tmp``` folder stores the dictionary when server closes and the named pipes when server is open

We have to use the ```make``` command inside each folder and start the server before running the client.

### Available commands in ```server``` and ```client``` folders are the following
* ```make``` : build the project

* ```make debug```  : build the project and run gdb for project

* ```make clear```  :  remove .o files therefore clearing the project
